# node.js-server-with-esp32
A simple sketch that shows how to communicate between esp32 and a node.js server with an html page and  CSS.
I have experimented in the last 2 weeks with javaScript, Node.js, html, CSS and the Arduino IDE to create a Server on my PC that will be able to show data from my esp32 board and send it data as well.
In order to run the server you will need to install the packeges that are in the package.json file by typeing opening the server.js and adding the .json files  and write in the terminal the command: <npm install>
then in the same repo, create a folder named: <public> and put there the index.html and styles.css files.
The esp32 code is named: <sketch_nov8a.ino>, I run it on my esp32 dev kit1 board.
I can recommend several quick tutorials on the subject that hellped me with this project:
